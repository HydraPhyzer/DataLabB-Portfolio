    Title: "PashtoLexi",
    Description:
      "Our approach to creating a Pashto language thesaurus involved a combination of manual and automated methods. We analyzed Pashto texts manually and compiled lists of synonyms and related words. We also used natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and classify words based on their semantic similarity. To train the word2vec model, we used a Pashto corpus and evaluated it on a Pashto journals dataset. Our proposed model outperformed all existing approaches and produced reasonable results.",
